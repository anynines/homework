## BOSH Introduction

Read the [introduction to BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs#intro).

## Setup BOSH Lite

Go to [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) and install BOSH Lite on your local machine.

## Create nginx BOSH Release

Read the section [Using BOSH to package and distribute software](https://bosh.io/docs#release).
Then create a BOSH release for nginx. It should display an empty page that is protected by basic authentication.
Please push your source code to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

There should be a sample deployment file (e.g. *examples/nginx.yml*) that we can execute to test your BOSH release.
Please provide a README.md (markdown) in the top directory on how to test your BOSH release with `curl`.
